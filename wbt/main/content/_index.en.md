# Introduction


The web-based training is used in the blended learning course for pre- and post-preparation. For each face-to-face session, there is a corresponding learning module, which is further divided into subchapters. Learning module 1 is solely for post-preparation, while it is expected that you work through the four subsequent learning modules before the face-to-face sessions. During the face-to-face sessions, you can ask your practical questions about R, and we will provide additional exercise tasks to reinforce your learning progress. You can find the links to the learning modules either directly below this text or in the menu on the left.

Please do not be surprised if a learning module is not yet online; we will gradually upload the learning modules throughout the semester.

Here are the links to the individual learning modules:
