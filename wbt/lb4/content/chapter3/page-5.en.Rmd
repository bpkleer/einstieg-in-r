**Autocorrelation** can be a problem in linear regression, especially when dealing with time series data. If **autocorrelation** is present, our estimators will be biased. **Autocorrelation** means that the value of the residual influences the subsequent value positively or negatively. Therefore, **autocorrelation** implies that the $i$-th residual value affects the $(i+1)$-th residual value.

**Autocorrelation** indicates temporal relationships (non-linear relationship) or the absence of variables in the model.

There are four ways to test for **autocorrelation**:

1. *lagged regression*

2. Durbin-Watson test ($lag = 1$)

3. Breusch-Godfrey test (adjustable *lag*)

4. Graphical analysis

## Option 1: *lagged regression* 
In this method, a regression of the residuals is simply calculated. The dependent variable is the residuals in reverse order (`res[-n]`), and the independent variable is the previous residual (`res[-1]`). We should obtain a non-significant value for the coefficient of `res[-1]`. If this is significant, **autocorrelation** may be present.

```{r autocor1, eval=TRUE}
res <- olsModel2$res  

n <- length(res)       

testmodel <- lm(res[-n] ~ res[-1]) 

summary(testmodel)
```

$\Rightarrow$ And we have obtained this in this case! If the effect is significant, you know that the respective previous residual has a significant (i.e., more than random) effect. And that means that autocorrelation is present.

## Variant 2: Durbin-Watson Test
Secondly, you can output the **Durbin-Watson statistic**. To do this, you use the `dwtest()` function from the **library** `lmtest`.

The **Durbin-Watson test** is a hypothesis test. The null hypothesis is:

$H_0$: Autocorrelation is equal to $0$.

The goal is to obtain a non-significant hypothesis test to reject the presence of autocorrelation.

In this test, the *lag* (delay) is always equal to $1$:
```{r dwtest, eval=TRUE}
dwtest(olsModel2)
```

$\Rightarrow$ As in Variant 1, the **Durbin-Watson test** also indicates that no autocorrelation is present.

## Variant 3: Breusch-Godfrey Test
A third way is to output the **Breusch-Godfrey test**. In this test, we can set the delay (*lag*). For this, we use the `bgtest()` function from the **library** `lmtest`.

The **Breusch-Godfrey test** is also a hypothesis test. As with the Durbin-Watson test, the null hypothesis is as follows:

$H_0$: Autocorrelation is equal to $0$.

The goal is, as with the Durbin-Watson test, to obtain a non-significant test result!

As before, in the first argument of the function, simply enter the regression object. In the second argument (`order`), you can set the *lag*.
```{r bgtest, eval=TRUE}
bgtest(
  olsModel2,
  order = 1
) 
```

$\Rightarrow$ Here too, we receive the information that no autocorrelation is present.

## Variant 4: Graphical Analysis
We could also plot the residuals to check for **autocorrelation**. To do this, simply use the `plot()` function again and now enter the residuals of the model as the data input. If autocorrelation is present, you would see a pattern like at the very beginning of this page.
```{r autocor-plot, eval=TRUE}
plot(olsModel2$residuals)
```

$\Rightarrow$ You can see that there is no pattern as above. By this, you confirm that there is no autocorrelation.
