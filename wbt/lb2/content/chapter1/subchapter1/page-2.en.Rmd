Now you will learn about the structure of a data table. In the screenshot, you can see the dataset of **PSS** limited to the four sample questions (variables) from the previous page.

```{r df-example, eval=TRUE, echo=FALSE}
paged_table(
  pss[, c("idno", "agea", "gndr", "income", "stfdem")],
  options = list(rows.print = 15)
)
```

{{% expand \"What can you observe in the table? What is in the columns and what is in the rows?\" %}}
You got it right! In a data table, the variables are represented in the columns and the cases in the rows. The special thing is the first row, as it does not contain answers but the names of the variables!
{{% /expand %}}

If you take a closer look at the variable `stfdem` now, you will see that only numerical values are entered there. Even for the code values `0` and `10`, the value labels from the PDF are not used, but the code value! **This is an important insight.** Because only when numerical values are used for all variations, the variable can be used as a metric scale level and stored in a *numeric* or *integer* vector. Because: All statistical calculations require *numeric* or *integer* vectors, as standard deviation cannot be calculated with letters.

{{% expand \"In which income target is the person with ID number 10020 located?\" %}}
In the 7th decile, correct! So, the cells of the data table contain the corresponding values of a surveyed person for the respective variable.

Great, you can now understand a data table or a **data frame** structure!
{{% /expand %}}

You have now understood how a data table is structured, what is contained in the rows, columns, and cells. In R, these data tables are stored as objects of type **data frame**.

![Example data frame in the Environment](../img/df1.en.png)

In the **Environment**, you can see that this falls under the group **data**. You also see that the object is *expandable*. If you click the arrow button, all variables (each with a `$` in front) that are summarized in this new object will appear. It is easy to understand that a **data frame** is simply the summary of all variables (or vectors in R) of a survey.

You can open the data view with a double-click. This is simply the data table as discussed above. The variables are in the columns and the cases are in the rows (except the first row!).

But how do you handle a dataset in R?
