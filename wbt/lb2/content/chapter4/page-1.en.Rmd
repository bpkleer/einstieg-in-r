The **if** statement is used when you want to execute a command under certain conditions. A condition is checked, and if it is true (`TRUE`), the specified operation is performed.

The logic of the simple **if** statement is illustrated in the diagram:

![Logic of the If Condition](../img/if.PNG){width=50%}

Let's consider the following example: We have a student's motivation level and want to output the comment *very motivated* (a vector `mot` with a single value) if the student has indicated a value greater than or equal to $7$ on the scale ($0$-$10$).

``` {r if, eval=FALSE}
mot <- 9

if (mot >= 7) {
  print("sehr motiviert")
}
```

So, the simple **if** statement follows a clear pattern:

1. **if** is called with the condition in parentheses: `if (mot >= 7)`

2. The instructions to be executed if the condition is true are enclosed in curly braces: `{ print("very motivated") }`

The simple **if** statement can be easily implemented. 

{ /* examples */ }

### If-Else Statement

In addition to the simple **if** statement, there are also **else if** statements that allow you to check additional conditions if the previous condition is not met. In this case, the process checks multiple conditions. This is illustrated in the diagram:

![Logic of the If Condition](../img/ifelse.PNG){width=50%}

For another scenario where a student has only indicated a motivation score of $5$, we could write the following **else if** statement:

```{r else-if, eval=FALSE}
mot <- 5

if (mot >= 7) {
  print("sehr motiviert")
} else if (mot >= 4 & mot < 7) {
  print("motiviert")
}
```

This means that the simple **if** syntax is only extended here by the following points:

1. another statement that checks an additional condition with **else if**: `else if (mot >= 4 & mot < 7)`

2. an additional block of instructions for the additional condition: `{ print("motivated")}`

This can also be implemented very easily. **The important thing here is**: The second condition is only checked if the first condition is `FALSE`. You can program as many `else if` checks as needed. Let's consider another example:

```{r else-if2, eval=FALSE}
mot <- 3

if (mot >= 7) {
  print("sehr motiviert")
} else if (mot >= 4 & mot < 7) {
  print("motiviert")
} else if (mot >= 0 & mot < 4) {
  print("nicht motiviert")
}
```

The only change we made here is adding a third condition check. As before, this third condition is only checked if both the first and second conditions are `FALSE`. **else if** statements have a **hierarchical** structure.

### Else Statement
You can also make dichotomous decisions. For example, let's say we want to differentiate only between *motivated* and *not motivated* individuals. We decide to classify individuals who have a score above $7$ as motivated and those with lower scale values as not motivated. Here, we only check the condition if the value is greater than $7$. If this is not the case, we decide with **else** (in all other cases) to output *not motivated*. **Else** contains an instruction that is executed for all cases where the previous **if** condition is not met (i.e., results in `FALSE`).

``` {r else, eval=FALSE}
mot <- 5

if (mot >= 7) {
  print("sehr motiviert")
} else {
  print("nicht motiviert")
}
```

Here the structure is quite simple as well:

1. we add another statement after the **if** condition with **else**, which does not have a condition anymore: `else`. Remember: With **else**, the condition is inherent, as it includes all `FALSE` cases of the previous condition.

2. Here again, we specify the statement in curly braces: `{ print("not motivated)}`


#### That's it!
These were simple examples of **if** and **else if** statements. Typically, these are used within loops (e.g., when making decisions for all observations within a dataset). This will be shown on the next page.
